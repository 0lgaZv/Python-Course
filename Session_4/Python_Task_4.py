#### Task 4.1
"""
Implement an abstract class named GeometricFigure. It should have abstract methods to calculate square
and perimeter of the figure.
"""

# code ...

#### Task 4.2
"""
Implement class named Circle. It must inherit abstract class GeometricFigure from Task 4.1. Instance of this
class is initialized by radius. It must have redefined methods of a parent class to calculate square and
perimeter of the circle. Tip: try to implement class Triangle, that does not implement abstract methods from
Geometric Figure. What will happen?

#### Task 4.3
"""
Write a function 'start quiz()` which has 5 questions with boolean options of answer inside itself.
The first question "What's your name?" is without scoring.

Example of quesions:
* Do you like this course? (_Yes_ / _No_)
* Do you want the next session? :) (_Yes_ / _No_)
* Is carrot red? (_Yes_ / _No_)
* ...
* ...

The number of points for each question depends on your fancy.
Note: use `input()` function to provide an opportunity to give the answer.
"""


#### Task 4.4 __Mini quiz__ 
"""
Write a Python class named Student with two attributes `student_name` and `mark`.
Implement a magic method `__call__` so that when you call this method then will start the survey from Task 3.4.
The result of quiz and name of student have to be written in `mark` and `student_name` attributes of class. 
After printing an instance of this class, should be displayed a message 'Student {student_name} has received {mark} points'.
